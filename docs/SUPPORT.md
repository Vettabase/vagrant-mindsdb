## Related software support

This Vagrantfile is only one piece of the mosaic. You may very well
encounter problems with Vagrant, Bash, or the Linux system among other
things. We can most probably help in those cases. However, you are
free to look for free or paid help elsewhere. Free help can sometimes
be found at vagrantup.com/community or in one of the many Linux or
devops virtual communities.

If your problem is specifically with MindsDB, there are still chances
that we can help, but the MindsDB company can provide a more experienced
support.
